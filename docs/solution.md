# Technical Solution

The system follows a TDD-first workflow guided by six cooperating agents:

1. **ArchitectAgent** breaks a user goal into modules and logs the plan to
   HipCortex.
2. **BuilderAgent** generates minimal code to satisfy the tests.
3. **TesterAgent** runs pytest on the generated code.
4. **ReflexionAgent** applies the AUREUS reasoning loop to failed test output and
   updates the BuilderAgent instructions.
5. **ExporterAgent** packages artefacts once tests pass.
6. **MonetizerAgent** records usage and creates Stripe charges.

All memory and reasoning context flows through `hipcortex_bridge.py`.  The
`build_test_cycle` function encapsulates the round‑trip from code generation to
testing and reflexion.

Each step is logged to HipCortex so that the AUREUS reflexion loop can analyse
failures and propose new builder instructions. This chain‑of‑thought history is
available in the dashboard via the *ReasoningPanel* component.

The frontend polls `/test_results` and `/improvement_suggestion` to provide live
feedback during the build process.
