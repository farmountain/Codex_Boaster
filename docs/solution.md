# Technical Solution

Codex Booster orchestrates multiple AI agents, including ArchitectAgent, BuilderAgent, TesterAgent, ReflexionAgent, ExporterAgent, and MonetizerAgent. HipCortex handles all long-term reasoning, memory, and goal alignment. Agents communicate through `hipcortex_bridge.py` to log actions and retrieve previous states.

The `TesterAgent` executes Python tests and records results. These results are exposed via the FastAPI endpoint `/test_results` so the frontend can display whether the last build passed or failed.
