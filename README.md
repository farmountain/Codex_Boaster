# Codex Booster

Codex Booster is an AIâ€‘native platform that turns natural language goals into
working software.  A set of specialised agents handle planning, code
generation, testing, reflexion and billing.  All reasoning state is recorded in
**HipCortex**, enabling a persistent memory of each build attempt.

## Quickstart

### Backend

2. Run the API using `uvicorn backend.main:app --reload`.
3. Visit `/docs` for interactive API documentation.

### Frontend

2. Install dependencies via `npm install`.
3. Start the dev server using `npm run dev`.

## Tests

To run all tests, including the UI components, execute:
```bash
pytest
npm test --silent
cd frontend && npm test --silent && cd ..
```
